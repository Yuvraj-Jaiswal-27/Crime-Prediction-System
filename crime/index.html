                Crimes are a common social problem affecting the quality of life and the economic growth of a society.
                It is considered an essential factor that determines whether or not people move to a new city and what
                places should be avoided when they travel. With the increase of crimes, law enforcement agencies are
                continuing to demand advanced geographic information systems and new web application approaches to
                improve crime analytics and better protect their communities.Although crimes could occur everywhere, it
                is common that criminals work on crime opportunities they face in most familiar areas for them. By
                providing a technology approach to determine the most criminal hotspots and find the type, location
                and<span id="dots">....</span><span id="more">
                    time of committed crimes, we hope to raise people’s awareness regarding the dangerous locations in
                    certain time periods.Therefore, our proposed solution can potentially help people stay away from the
                    locations at a certain time of the day along with saving lives. In addition, having this kind of
                    knowledge would help people to improve their living place choices. On the other hand, police forces
                    can
                    use this solution to increase the level of crime prediction and prevention. Moreover, this would be
                    useful for police resources allocation. It can help in the distribution of police at most likely
                    crime
                    places for any given time, to grant an efficient usage of police resources. By having all of this
                    information available, we hope to make our community safer for the people living there and also for
                    others who will travel there.</span>
